    Today (July 23rd):
    - We are going to add server tagging
        - Use the spatie package
        - Connect with nova and build out resources
    - And if we get time, we are going to explore tracking players per server, per 5m
        - We will need seeders
        - We will need factories
        - We will need a migration for the table

    Today (July 27th):
    - We are going to add a responsive package to make nova work on all devices
        - https://novapackages.com/packages/gregoriohc/laravel-nova-theme-responsive
    - We are going to add server attributes (a polymorphic table, so we can store other attributes later)
    - We are going to explore how nova handles these types of relationships
    - We are going to explore how to query these relationships with performance in mind
