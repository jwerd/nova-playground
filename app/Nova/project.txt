    Today (July 23rd):
    - We are going to add server tagging
        - Use the spatie package
        - Connect with nova and build out resources
    - And if we get time, we are going to explore tracking players per server, per 5m
        - We will need seeders
        - We will need factories
        - We will need a migration for the table

php artisan migrate:refresh && php artisan db:seed && php artisan fake:servers
