## Nova Playground

I built this project to quickly learn laravel nova.  It houses a server listing project I wrote a long time ago, but reimagined for laravel nova.

A few key features:
- Ability to create games
- Ability to create server listings under games
- Ability to tag server listings
- Ability to keep a heartbeat of server updates (player count, etc)
- Ability to set attributes per sever and per game

## Future stuff

- Trend metrics
- Comment system
